# Helpdesk_Agent_Assistant_Bot
The Helpdesk Agent Assisted Bot automates the creation of helpdesk tickets in Zoho Desk, streamlining the process for agents. Triggered by the ALT + S hotkey, the bot reads ticket details from a Request.xlsx file located in the 'Requests' folder. It processes this file using the ReadExcelRequest.xaml workflow, extracting and storing the ticket information in variables. The extracted data is then passed to the ZohoAutomation.xaml workflow, which automatically creates a ticket in Zoho Desk. After successfully creating the ticket, the bot moves the processed Request.xlsx file to the 'Processed' folder, allowing the agent to repeat the process with a new file. The agent can stop the automation at any time using the 'STOP' option in UiPath Studio. This bot improves operational efficiency by reducing manual input and ensuring consistency in ticket creation.
